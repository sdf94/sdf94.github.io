I am data scientist, emphasizing in data scraping, data wrangling, and machine learning. I love to code and to analyze large data sets. But you know what I love more? CUstomers, students, and all sorts of other individuals who leave a trail of data and figuring out what they need and want. By analyzing the trail, I can now understand and help people.
